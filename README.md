# calendar-app
The calendar application is designed to display Telugu dates, Nakshatra, and the phases of the New Moon and Full Moon, all aligned with Gregorian dates. It integrates the mhah-panchang package to provide accurate Telugu calendar details and the date-fns package to handle date operations and formatting. This combination ensures that users can view and interact with a calendar that reflects traditional Telugu astrological elements and lunar phases alongside the standard Gregorian calendar dates.
